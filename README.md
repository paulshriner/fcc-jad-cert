# freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certificate

These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

* Palindrome Checker

        A page to check if a given input string is a palindrome (expression that is the same forward and backward).

* Roman Numeral Converter
       
        A page that converts a decimal number input to its roman numeral counterpart.

* Phone Number Validator

        A page that checks if a phone number is valid according to typical U.S. phone number formats.
